# Vagrant iac (Infra as a Code) on AWS - Demo

This is a simple repo to demonstrate how to implement iac using Vagrant on AWS. We have implemented **iac (Infra-As-A-Code)** and CaaC(Configuration-as-code) using Vagrant and Ansible. 

Refer **[READEME](https://github.com/ginigangadharan/vagrant-iac-usecases/blob/master/README.md)** for environment setup
